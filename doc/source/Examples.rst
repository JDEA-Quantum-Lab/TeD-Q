Examples
==============================

Please refer to the iPython notebooks in the `Examples`

Qubit Rotation
----------------
Use simple gradient descent method to rotate the qubit to the target angle.

QNN Circuit Examples
---------------------
Show the usage of three commonly-used circuit templates

Quanvolution Neural Network
----------------------------
This example is based on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04767): 

``Quanvolutional Neural Networks: Powering Image Recognition with Quantum Circuits.``

This example aimed at showing the performance and the usage of the this new quantum processing framework. 

Quantum Transfer Learning
---------------------------
In this example, we show the method to train quantum neural network with transfer learning method. We utilize the classical pre-trained model -- ResNet18 and replace its last fully-connected layer with the self-defined quantum model. 

Simple Variational Quantum Eigensolver
----------------------------------------
Show how to find eigenstate with lowest eigenvalue by QAI framework
